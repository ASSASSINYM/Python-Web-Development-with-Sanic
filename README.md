**An in-depth guide for Python web developers to improve the speed and scalability of web applications**

## What is this book about?
Todayâ€™s developers need something more powerful and customizable when it comes to web app development. They require effective tools to build something unique to meet their specific needs, and not simply glue a bunch of things together built by others. This is where Sanic comes into the picture. Built to be unopinionated and scalable, Sanic is a next-generation Python framework and server tuned for high performance. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the difference between WSGI, Async, and ASGI servers
* Discover how Sanic organizes incoming data, why it does it, and how to make the most of it
* Implement best practices for building reliable, performant, and secure web apps
* Explore useful techniques for successfully testing and deploying a Sanic web app
* Create effective solutions for the modern web, including task management, bot integration, and GraphQL
* Identify security concerns and understand how to deal with them in your Sanic apps

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Python web developers who have basic to intermediate-level knowledge of how web technologies work and are looking to take their applications to the next level using the power of the Sanic framework. Working knowledge of Python web development along with frameworks such as Django and/or Flask will be helpful but is not required. A basic to intermediate-level understanding of Python 3, HTTP, RESTful API patterns, and modern development practices and tools, such as type annotations, pytest, and virtual environments will also be beneficial.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
